# Bitmap font descriptor

POJO definition of a bitmap font description.

## Dependency

[maven central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.maamissiniva/maamissiniva-bitmap-font-descriptor)

## Warning

There is no support for kerning or ligature. Only variable width.

## Description

Stored information about the rasterized font:

 - font name
 - font size at rasterization time
 - mapping of characters to glyph
 - glyph bitmap definitions

Glyph bitmap coordinates are relative to the font bottom and glyph
left origin using cartesisian coordinates with a bottom left origin,
not screen coordinates with a top left origin.

The font bottom is the max descent of the original font.

| line        | value                |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| bottom      | 0, origin            |
| max descent | same as bottom       |
| descent     | distance from bottom |
| baseline    | distance from bottom |
| ascent      | distance from bottom |
| max ascent  | distance from bottom |
| top         | same as max ascent   |

Definitions should be understood as in 
[this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27631736/meaning-of-top-ascent-baseline-descent-bottom-and-leading-in-androids-font).

### Glyph bitmap

A glyph provides:

 - draw coordinates relative to botton and left
 - logical coordinates 
 - texture coordinates, not pixel coordinates
 - advance (coordinates of next glyph)

## Serialization

The expected file format is JSON generated by [jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson).
